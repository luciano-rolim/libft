# Libft
- Libft is the first project of Common Core, and it consist in creating your own custom library of functions - see subject_libft.pdf for more details.

- I've also created a custom int main to test most of the functions. The function is in a separate file, lib_test.c

- To run this custom test, just compile all .c files at once (including lib_test.c) and run ./a.out

- Pro-tip: since this project has a lot of .c files, compile using *.c wildcard. For example: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c will compile all .c files at once.
